# Clanker 📚🎬

Clanker is a short-form educational content app designed to make learning as engaging and effortless as scrolling. Inspired by platforms like YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels, Clanker delivers bite-sized educational videos tailored to a user’s interests, allowing them to swipe through content and stop on what captures their attention.

Our goal is to transform passive scrolling into active learning.

## Overview

Clanker aggregates and recommends short-form educational videos across a wide range of subjects, such as mathematics, science, engineering, and other learning-focused domains. Instead of relying on traditional long-form lectures, Clanker emphasizes concise, focused explanations that fit naturally into a modern scrolling experience.

Users can:
- Discover new educational topics
- Learn in short, digestible segments
- Build learning habits without committing to long sessions

---

## How It Works

1. Users scroll through a vertical feed of short-form educational videos.
2. Videos automatically play as they come into view.
3. Users can swipe past content they’re not interested in or continue watching videos that capture their attention.
4. User interactions (watch time, skips, replays) are used to improve future recommendations.

Clanker prioritizes educational value while maintaining the intuitive UX of modern short-form platforms.
